### JavaFit: CSCE 314 Java Project

# Project Overview
Fitness for Computer Scientists! JavaFit is a Java application to assist its users to create workouts by reading the given CSV file of workouts for different body parts, and building a workout based on the input of its users. The first phase of this project involved creating just the backend with a Workouts class and the required methods, as well as the CSV file reader.

## Instructions

# Overview:
This project is composed of two parts. This is phase 1. The questions posed in the comments were to be anwsered in a text file for points.

# Coding:
Our job was to extend the functionality of the provided code. Do not delete or alter any of the given code. Your code must have the same return values and function prototypes as what is provided, as well as the same level of information hiding and encapsulation.

You have two parts to this phase of the project. The first is to create an object to embody the concept of “Workouts.”  The data values you need for a workout are already in the skeleton file. You will need to write code to handle the expected methods of the Workouts class. You will need to write helper methods to perform these tasks.

The second part of this phase is to write a file reader that will load the workouts from a CSV (comma separated values) file into the Workouts object. You can assume that there are no extra commas in the CSV file that need to be escaped. All commas act as separators.

The main javaFit file has a series of function calls that will be used to test the performance of your code. Do not modify these. Looking at these lines of code will give you some insight into how your code will be used.

# Style:
Glen mentioned the importance of use a specific programming style. The refactor tool was used to rename class names as per the Google Java Style Guide. 

# Notes:
Indents in these files are set to 2 spaces. 

# Contents:
1) Working code with none of Glen's code modified.(Graded on completeness, checked for compliance with Academic Honesty standards).
2) Text file with the questions from the comments anwsered concisely, precisely and with examples.

## Build Status
Build Passing

## Code Style
Standard Java (SE 8) using the Google Java Style Guide.

## Tech Used
This application was written entirely in Java, from the Eclipse editor as instructed. It was tested in a Linux command line (Git Bash).

## Features
The user can construct workouts based upon the muscle group(s) and using the equipment that the user enters.

## Installation
TODO: Figure out installation and write an explanation.

## Use Instructions
This will depend on how the application is installed, but from the command line, to use this application one must:
1) Navigate to the directory with the source files (javaFit.java specifically).
2) Compile the program using ``` javac javaFit.java ```.
3) Run the program using ``` java javaFit ```.

## Contributing
This project is complete and not intended for outside contributions; I may extend the functionality at a later date, but will most likely do so independently.

## Credits
The skeleton code and the base code was written by a TA for my CSCE 314 class, Glen Hordmann. The repository that this was taken from is located at https://github.com/tdeng100/Project-CSCE314.git.
As mentioned, the style guide utilized was the Google Java Style Guide at https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html.
This README was written based upon the format found at https://medium.com/@meakaakka/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3.
Various articles and tutorials were used for help in creating this project and in anwsering the questions.
